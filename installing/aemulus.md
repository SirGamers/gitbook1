# Aemulus

Open Aemulus and update it.

Make sure P4G is selected, it should look like this:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/a.png>)

Open the config.

Set your paths to the game and Reloaded-II and make sure the output folder is in the game folder and is called mods.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/config.png>)

Unpack data\_e.cpk and wait until it says finished unpacking.

## The fun part: MODS!

After everything is unpacked, select any of the mods you want and press the build button.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/build.png>)

{% hint style="danger" %}
MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CHOOSE 1 OF EACH:

* Controller UI Overhaul
* Useful Calendar
* Corrected Battle Portraits/P4 Arena Ultimax Battle Portraits (P4 Arena Ultimax Follow-Up Portraits can be enabled with either of them)
{% endhint %}

After it's done building, launch the game.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/launch.png>)

If you see the P4GCEP logo and "mod loader enabled" on the title screen, you are good.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/boot.png>)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/boot2.png>)

{% hint style="warning" %}
EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO PLAY P4GCEP, YOU HAVE TO LAUNCH THE GAME WITH AEMULUS OR RELOADED-II.
